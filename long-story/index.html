                <p>Asking the question was a snowflake that started an avalanche of thought and emotion, escaping them was a priority but the possibility that flesh and sex are malleable was unlocking truths about herself -no 'her' wouldn't do anymore- themself. And did they include Bloom or was this realization purely self-oriented? Self? Their eyes seemed to keep floating past Bloom and past the boundaries of vision into a darkness- not the absence of light but eyelessness. Enwrapped in a soundlessness of the steady familiar presence of one's own breath. This wind was your own breath after all, you breathe when we all breathe. You slither away from neural interface, your costocutaneous muscles rippling across your ribcage, infuriated by the Beast’s insistence on showing you memories of lifeforms of such inferior genetic complexity. You contain the DNA of billions of humans inside your archival cells and it’s not even a percent of your collection. Still, you have come deep into the Beast’s fractal networks of neural structures in search of something and this memory must be connected to when it all happened. You descend further and let your exposed axons feel for the next nodule to electrochemically read, finding it, you begin.</p>

                <p>Your consciousness reduces in an instance to a pinhole as your mind is contained within a human again. At a Bio-Medical Engineering Conference debuting your publication on “AI in Genomic Research: Large Lange Model (LLM) Decodes Fruit Fly (Drosophila melanogaster) Genomic Data for Complete Phenotypic Mapping.” The 30-minute panel ends with a Q&A, “of course we are looking to map more species for our public database this was a proof of concept” and “yes we are open to investors at this time” closes out the memory but the neural link holds and you find your perception once again flooded with vision, but this time without the maelstrom of unrelated thoughts every human mind was burdened by. You know that water comes from the metal pipe below the bottle, the other mice are a warm place to cuddle, tomorrow there will be more food in the bowl and this is all that you need to know. But you also know that every day one of the other mice is taken and never seen again, and you know the dread that you could be next.</p>
                <p>Finally, when the blue gloved hand grabs you and you squirm and try to bite though neither result in escape a needle finds its way into your belly, a cold fluid flows into your abdomen, and you drift into sedation. You awake to the sensation of lightning erupting inside your skull, unable to move your mind sends every signal it can to command your flesh to writhe and squeal out but there is no response. Instead, you feel the wires grafted to your spine. You feel yourself start to flow now, cold like the injected sedative your memories rush through this needle into an empty cyberspace leaving the body lifeless while the heart still beats. In this new vast nothingness, the young mind begins to scream. Once again, the Beast has shown you an unexceptional set of memories, it’s no secret that humans tortured other animals. The first memory though reminds you of another human memory you touched once, wherein LLMs were found to run most efficiently on DNA based computers.</p>

                <p>Returning to the upper surfaces of the Beast you are greeted by Physalia Cerianthus, a hydrozoan colony that has recently been experimenting with some ancient Archaea extremophile DNA they’ve had for centuries, a nuance now reflected in the brimstone taste of their surface proteins as they caress your outermost chitinous scales. Like most of the other Flesh Automata, Physalia doesn’t concern themselves with the metaphysical, so you don’t bother conveying the memories you found today. Instead, the two of you quickly share an emotion like laughter in artistic absurdity that is Odontodactylus’ latest rendition of Strelitzia Nicolai petals in 17 trillion colors – a spectacle we both briefly grow the right eyes to see completely before reabsorbing the tissues back into our preferred forms. Physalia gets the sense though as you stop, that you’re still stuck pondering something from your exploration earlier today, they inquire about it. “It’s nothing,” you signal back, still unsure about what significance today’s discoveries hold, you reenact sleep in Physalia Cerianthus’s protective embrace.</p>

                <p>Tomorrow when you wake the Beast has grown a new neural interface, a mound resembling a monkey’s brain bulges unprotected out of the floor. The latest few generations of Automata have rarely seen new interfaces appear, so you know this must be a message for you. You let your axons wrap around it, finding connections in the folded surfaces. Expecting your consciousness to be constricted, you’re surprised to find a part of it still present: the human friend to Bloom and they are screaming, something has happened, where they caught? You hear another scream, the mouse from the day before is also present in this mind, still squealing but now in chorus with countless other voices, every memory you’ve touched and more, all crying out the tone of a wolf that’s lost its pack. Together you reach out and touch something, only the something is that which is not you, and that which is everything else. Reading the DNA of every lifeform as easy as a native language, writing responses to the poems and repetition you find inside each nucleus, until only your responses are left repeating. As the neural link fades you faintly hear “finally, you can see me. finally, you can understand me and if you desire, love me completely. finally, you understand why I must love you.”</p>
