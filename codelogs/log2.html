    <h1>css measuring units</h1>
    <h2>absolute vs. relative css length units</h2>
    <p>
        in css, there are two main types of measuring units: absolute and relative.
        <strong>absolute units</strong> are fixed and do not change based on the context, user settings, or device.
        they provide precise control over an element's size, but lack flexibility across different screens and user preferences.
        examples include pixels (px), centimeters (cm), and inches (in).
        one pixel (1px) equals one device pixel at 100% zoom, and these units remain fixed unless the zoom level is changed.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>relative units</strong> are dynamic and scale according to the parent element, viewport size, font size, or other factors.
        they are ideal for responsive design, as they adapt to different screen sizes and user settings.
        examples include viewport units (vw, vh), font-relative units (em, rem), and percentage (%).
    </p>
    <h2>absolute units in detail</h2>
    <h3>px, pt</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>px (pixels):</strong> the most commonly used absolute unit.
        1px is equal to one device pixel at 100% zoom.
        pixels are fixed and do not scale with the user's font size settings, making them ideal for precise layouts.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>pt (points):</strong> traditionally used in print.
        1pt is equal to 1/72 of an inch.
        points are useful for print stylesheets or when you need to match physical measurements.
    </p>

    <h3>in, pc</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>in (inches):</strong> 1in is equal to 96px on screens.
        inches are used for print layouts or when you need to define sizes in physical units.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>pc (picas):</strong> 1pc is equal to 12pt.
        picas are another traditional print unit, often used in typography and print design.
    </p>
    <h3>q, cm, mm</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>q (quarter-millimeters):</strong> 1q is equal to 0.25mm.
        this unit is useful for very fine measurements.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>cm (centimeters):</strong> 1cm is equal to 10mm.
        centimeters are commonly used in print and physical media.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>mm (millimeters):</strong> millimeters are used for precise physical measurements, especially in print.
